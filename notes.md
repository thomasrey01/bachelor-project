### Questions: 
    Arno responding late
    Hashing necessary?

contact study advisor

1). Memory (hashmap) vs disk (database) for data retrieval
height checking for lower level only


### Questions: 
    look at 1.
    academic advisor response, dates and latest from both supervisors.
    api 

have meeting with academic advisor:
    some courses have deadlines
    discussion about master's

better with memory (not too many constraints
send email to biehl about dates
raspberry pi b+
email arno floor plan, for an aisle, how many rows (begin and end number)
how many stickers per aisle (min to max) (what codes are in the aisle)

### Questions
    Back and forth with Cor
    possible to do presentation and afterwards hand in document

Add data to git repo
continue emailing Cor, ask about how to know which labels are on the floor plan
for thesis: research into pattern recognition for extracting floor plan, the optimal transport, pixel to coords

# 14/07/2023

work with height of stickers
band from shelf uncertainty

# 26/07/2023

TODO: abstraction of label decoder for different types of labels
start on thesis. emphasizing on green energy/coding (e.g. hashing of shelves).
Model aisle and shelves in classes instead of the whole map. Will make hashing easier, can have a method for
each aisle/row.

future-proof
in intro... all info (such as hashing and tree)
write about why some solutions aren't suitable
copyright free floorplan
can use sticker
